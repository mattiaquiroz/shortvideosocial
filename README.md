# ShortVideoApp (Learning Project)

This is a personal practice project where Iâ€™m trying to build a basic version of a short-form video platform, similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

The purpose is to explore how such platforms work technically, both on the frontend (mobile interface) and backend (video handling, user management, etc.).

It is primarily for learning and testing purposes.

- PostgreSQL (database)
- Local file system for video storage
- Flutter (mobile app)

## Backend Stack

- Spring Boot (Java)
